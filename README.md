A transpiler written in python for the AQA pseudocode language. 
In this transpiler I have implemented a type inference algorithm from scratch, which enables to statically type check and optimise a dynamically typed language. 
This project was used as part of AQA A-level computer science coursework, and I produced a 230 page report, which included motivation, documentation and thorough unit tests. 
The coursework received a mark of 74/75.
